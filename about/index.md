<center><b>Felix Limanta</b></center>

I'm Felix Limanta, a sophomore currently taking Informatics in Institut Teknologi Bandung, Indonesia since 2015.

I mostly deal with backend stuff and behavior algorithms in most of the projects I've been in. I'm also exploring a bunch of things that might suit me.

Others to be added as soon as I think of something.
